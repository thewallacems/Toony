# Toony

Toony is a menu bar MacOS launcher for Toontown Rewritten. 
This program was created to give users a much easier way to launch your toons than other launchers using the menu bar. 
This launcher allows you to save multiple logins and be able to login with one click without having to type in your 
login information every time.

# Disclaimer
As with the official Toontown Rewritten launcher, you will have to allow the launcher to monitor inputs. 
You can do this by opening System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Input Monitoring, then add the launcher there.
